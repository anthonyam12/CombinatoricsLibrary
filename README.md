# Latin Squares Research

The library is initially filled with research on Latin squares. The research document can be found [here](http://www.anthonymorast.com/docs/undergradReport.pdf).

## Latin Squares Class
Under the 'LatinSquare' directory there are some options for those wanting an easy to use C++ class for handling Latin squares.

There is a LatinSquare class in LatinSquare_hdrOnly.hpp which is a header-only distribution of this class. The second option is to take the LatinSquare.cpp, LatinSquare.h and InvalidSquareException.h files and compile them with you project. Because the benefits of using header-only libraries are controversial, I've decided to include both options so a user can choose their preference.
